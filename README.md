# vehiculo-consola
This is a simple example of a custom Python class (vehicle) that depends and interacts with other classes.

Run vehicle.py to check it out. In this example the action happens solely on the command window.

The controls are as follows:

s -> switch left blinker

a -> switch right blinker

w -> increase engine rpm

z -> decrease engine rpm

e -> shift up a gear

d -> shift down a gear

r -> increase environmental light

f -> decrease environmental light

q -> quit (end program)
